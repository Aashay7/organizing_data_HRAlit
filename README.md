# HRA Literature
Welcome to the HRA Literature GitHub repository. This repository contains the supporting code and data for the paper that documents the compilation of the HRAlit dataset.

## Introduction
This repository provides the supporting code and data for "Publication, Funding, and Experimental Data in Support of Human Reference Atlas Construction and Usage" paper, detailing the assembly of the HRAlit dataset â€” a comprehensive compilation linking HRA data to various entities like experts, publications, and ontologies. Our aim is to facilitate a deeper exploration of HRA trends, from identifying leading experts and major publications to understanding funding patterns and alignment with existing ontologies.

## Quick Start
### Requirements:
- **PostgreSQL**: Ensure you have PostgreSQL installed on your system.
- **PSQL CLI**: The command-line interface (CLI) application for PostgreSQL should also be installed.
### Download dataset
- **SQL Database**: To access the HRAlit database using SQL, you can use the provided SQL file: [hralit.sql](data/db/hralit.sql)
- **CSV Tables**: If you prefer to work with CSV files, we've provided individual CSVs for each table in the HRAlit database. 
### Restore the Database from the Dump:
```psql -U [your-username] -d [your-database-name] < hralit.sql```

## Running Reports
### Summary statistics
[This section](application/app0) is for the summary statistic of HRAlit database, including linkage counts, node counts, publication comparison among ASCT+B table, CellMarker, and CZ CELLxGENE.

### Providing Data Evidence for the HRA
[This section](application/app1) is for providing expert, publication, and experimental data evidence for the HRA.
- **Statistic**: The total number of publications, citations, experts, Avg. h-index, funded projects, funders, datasets, cells for 31 organ.
- **Visualization**: Visualizations for these statistics.

### Comparison with different datasets
[This section](application/app2) is for comparing the publications among ASCT+B table, CellMarker, and CZ CELLxGENE.

### Prioritize Atlas Contruction
[This section](application/app3) is for computing the types of DOs and HRAlit data types per organ to help prioritize HRA construction. 

### HRA diversity
[This section](application/app4) is for analyzing the diversity and inclusiveness of HRA survey, HRA experts, general publication authors, and donor metadata.
- **Predicting Gender**: uses [gender_guesser](https://pypi.org/project/gender-guesser/) package to determine gender based on the first name.
- **Predicting Race**: uses [ethnicolr](https://github.com/appeler/ethnicolr) package to determine race based on the first name and last name.

## Development
### Extract data
This section is for extracting data in different types sourced from different datasets.
- [**Experimental data**](extract/experimental-data): Extract the CellMarker, CZ CELLxGENE, HRA digital objects, HuBMAP data. Merge data from these four sources, and output the dataset metadata and donor metadata.
    - CellMarker: Human cell markers via [CellMarker](http://xteam.xbio.top/CellMarker/index.jsp) portal. 
    - CZ CELLxGENE: Datasets for Healthy human adult are extracted via [CELLxGENE Census](https://chanzuckerberg.github.io/cellxgene-census/index.html) API, including datasets and donors.

    - AS, CT, B: Etract the id, rdfs_label, and name.
    - Linkages: Tag ```part_of ``` for ASs, ```located_in``` for ASs and CTs, ```is_a``` for CTs, ```characterizes``` for CTs and Bs.
- [**Publication**](extract/publication): Extract the HRA references and PubMed publications associated with [31 organs in 5th release HRA](data/experimental/organ.csv), and calculated citation using WoS data.
    - HRA references: Extract the general references and spetific referencs in 5th release ASCT+B tables through [CCF-ASCTB-ALL data](data/ontology/ccf-asctb-all.json).
    - PubMed: Retrieve the PubMed publications where the titles or MeSH terms contain any of the 31 organ names. 
    - Web of Science: Using WoS data linked by WoS IDs to PMIDs, count publication citations, which refers to the number of paper citing a publication.
- [**Experts**](extract/experts):  From PubMed data, extract the authors associated with the selected PubMed publications. Additionaly, extract the HRA experts across all versions, including creators and reviewers.
    - HRA experts: Extract the creators and reviewers from [HRA metadata across five versions](data/hra-v1.4-metadata.json), including ORCIDs, author names, associated digital objects. 
    - Authors: Extract the authors with ORCIDs associated with the selected publications, and query the informations for authors. Then calculate authors' h-indexes based on the citation data from WoS data.
- [**Funding**](extract/funding): From PubMed data, extract the funding data associated with the selected PubMed publications (in database section). Additionaly, extract additional funded project data sourced from six agencies, inlcuding Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC) , the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) , European Commission (EC) , Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKEN), National Institutes of Health (NIH), and National Science Foundation (NSF).
